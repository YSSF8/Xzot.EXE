This is an undetected malware test, open it in the Virtual Machine only

This was only a test virus made with Python.
Open it only in the VM (VirtualMachine), it will not destroy the boot-sector, but it will make your pc unusable so you'll need to restart it, so if you don't want to restart & wait for the pc to re-open just use the VM if you have downloaded it already.

It will not work properly in the Windows Sandbox.
